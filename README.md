👋 Hey there! I'm Nevil Ingutu, a 🖥️ code-loving programmer who writes code for a living 💻.
My expertise lies in 🐍 Python, 🟢 Node.js, and my favorite framework - 🔥 Flutter. 
I ☕ love coffee almost as much as I love coding, and you can often find me sipping a cup while writing code.

When I'm not coding or drinking coffee, I'm probably 🎮 gaming on my PC. 
Some of my favorite titles include 🌌 No Man's Sky and 🚗 Forza Horizon.
And speaking of programming humor, I have a few programming jokes up my sleeve that are sure to make you 🤣!

Feel free to browse through my GitHub repositories to see some of my recent work. 
And if you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about coding over a cup of coffee ☕, don't hesitate to reach out!```
